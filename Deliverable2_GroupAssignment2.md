# Group Rationale
This assignment (by Amit Gandhi, Alexis Kim, Pranali Mane, Han Wang, Xiaoxin Wang, Bo Zhao) was focused on “Schema and instance diagrams” and prompted us to revisit our prior model of the University of Kentucky Student awards and prizes. During this round, we took into account feedback from the professor and our classmates. The feedback we received was, as a whole, helpful and so we attempted to sift through and utilize the advice given. Some notable things that were changed were:  removing financial aid, correcting the cardinality, and combining offices to reduce redundancies. Other changes have been made that would be too long to list here, so rationale is organized in sections according to the reviewer who made the suggestion.

## Professor Review:
The professor made several important points which we considered while finalising out final Entity classes and Relationships. The first thing we changed was combined the Admin offices together as it was redundant and relationships too were combined for the same. We kept the Provost Office separate as it does other duties than just approving the awards. Also, the cardinality for Student and department was reversed and changed from 1-to-many to  many-to-one. The checks relationship was changed to submits to have clarity as to what the relationship and the process meant. Also, as professor said, the class Student Financial Aid office was just there for the sake of relationship and had no proper attributes to explaining the class, we decided to remove it as an Entity Class. The changes suggested and we didn’t consider were necessary were of the Provost being a class of Transaction events. Instead, we added attributes called Transaction ID and Transaction Number in the Financial Services class to explain the transactions made with respect to the Award amount.  

## Reviewer 1:
Our first student reviewer made may and specific suggestions. As will soon be evident, he was one of many to suggest the removal or change of Financial Aid, which was done. There was also a suggestion to change Admin Office to Admin Officers; a change was made, but rather this, admin office and employee were separated to better distinguish these classes to show special approval for an award and who awarded it. He also suggested we add a Policy, but we considered it superfluous and instead revised Guidelines to try and be clearer since we felt it was for a similar purpose. This reviewer also suggestion some relationship changes that we felt were useful; yet we did not incorporate them at face-value, because of the overall larger changes in classes. They were considered in the revision such as the inclusion of cash awards being incorporated as the “cardholder”.

## Reviewer 2:
One of Reviewer 2’s overarching suggestions was gleaned from, “Therefore, those attributes which are dependent on a non-key attribute from the original relation must be removed.”, we took this to mean that foreign keys should be removed and attempted to do so in this final diagram and during the greater attribute revision process of meeting 2. A more specific suggestion was given in that we should rename “Department Name” to “Department ID”; nevertheless, the team reckoned that these elements would play different purposes and incorporated Department ID in the case of multiple students from a department receiving an award.

## Reviewer 3:
Reviewer 3 had some notable points that we took into consideration. Notably we removed the student ID attribute from many classes. He also made suggestions as to the University Financial Services, but we overhauled departments that had to do with finance, so the suggestions related to this were taken in a broad manner when the new classes “Financial Services” and “PRD” were implemented. One point that was debated was the number of awards, initially this was kept, because it was suggested that this overall does affect the potential for awards in the future; however, for the end diagram it was eliminated to focus on core attributes.

## Reviewer 4:
There were also some good reviews and points mentioned by reviewer four. One of that was to change the cardinality between student and department from many-to-1 to many-to-many. The reason was that one student can belong to multiple departments i.e. a person from Biology department can also belong to Chemistry department as he could have multiple majors. The group agreed to this point and changed the cardinality to many-to-many. He/she had other ideas like making a Procedure class to explain the procedure to give awards. But, procedure could not have any attributes and only has a relationship making a strong case to not include it as a class. Also, while making a database, it won’t form a table on it own, but will give a way to form other tables and relationships. Further, our team agreed that we didn't need to describe the award guidelines in detail, because they are listed in the document and the class should mention only different categories and who approves each category. 

## Reviewer 5
Reviewer 5 suggested to include an attribute called ‘Department Type’ to explain the department of student. But we already have an attribute called Department Name which is self explanatory of the type of department and including a new attribute will be redundant. Also, he suggested that there will be students who are not registered to University and still apply for awards. But the document clearly mentions awards are only for University of Kentucky students. So, it isn’t necessary to include a ‘Student type’ attribute in Student class. Also, as other reviewers and Professor mentioned, we should combine all the admins together (Dean, Director, Provost and President) and we considered the suggestion and made all into one ‘Admin Office’ class except Provost, and one common relationship as ‘Approves’. This is because Provost has other duties than just approving the awards, i.e. maintaining a record of approved awards and form relationship with the Financial Services.
Reviewer 5 also proposed changing the Award entity and made specific suggestions; we did make changes to this entity but not to his exact specifications.

## Reviewer 6
The reviewer suggested same suggestions as already suggested by all the above reviewers i.e to combine the Admin offices together and keep the ‘processes’,’refers’ and ‘approves’ relationship as one. The reviewer also suggested to change cardinality of student and department which we already did. The changes were made accordingly to finalise the classes for Schema diagram.

## Reviewer 7:
Reviewer 7 had said to create a separate class for each category of Award Guidelines but this could just make the relationships of ‘refers to’ redundant for each class. The other reviews which were suggested to combine the Admin Offices are already changed. One thing we changed based on the review was to include a Special Approval attribute in the Admin Office class to account for approvals made by President or Director.

## Conclusion:
Between the last group assignment and this one we have been able to improve our team dynamic through open communication about the material (via messenger and the forum) and work more efficiently during in-person meetings. Our first meeting for group assignment 2 was more collaboratively structured, where we were able to read over the reviews, but each focused in on a few; this allowed for each member to be “in-charge” of a meaningful part, but others still had the capacity to debate proposed changes. It was also this meeting where we split up assignments generally. In the second meeting, we took a more debate style approach, since the focus was specifying names, refining the attributes listed and both adding and eliminating classes and relationships. During this assignment, a dynamic shift took place and more talkative members were a bit quieter and quieter members were more vocal. We attribute this to working together more and improving our group sensitivity.
