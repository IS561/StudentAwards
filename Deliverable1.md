# Overview

The following work is the collaborative effort of Amit Gandhi, Alexis Kim, Pranali Mane, Han Wang, Xiaoxin Wang and Bo Zhao. We tried to do a detailed study on our topic, Students Awards and Prizes as it had complex rules and information, in order to build a simple, scalable data model. An information system based on these modelling options, would help a Universityâ€™s Financial Services department handle Student Awards and Prizes system smoothly.
As per the constraints of this assignment, we have limited out total entity classes and relationships to 20, with minimum 5 of each. Following are our recommended classes and relationships and the rationale behind them:
